;;;; Basic implementation of Geometry.
;;;;
;;;; The spatial analysis methods will return the most specific class possible
;;;; to represent the result. If the result is homogeneous, a Point,
;;;; LineString, or Polygon will be returned if the result contains a single
;;;; element; otherwise, a MultiPoint, MultiLineString, or MultiPolygon will
;;;; be returned. If the result is heterogeneous a GeometryCollection will be
;;;; returned.
;;;; The results computed by the set-theoretic methods may contain
;;;; constructed points which are not present in the input Geometry. These
;;;; new points arise from intersections between line segments in the edges
;;;; of the input Geometry. In the general case it is not possible to
;;;; represent constructed points exactly. This is due to the fact that the
;;;; coordinates of an intersection point may contain twice as many bits of
;;;; precision as the coordinates of the input line segments. In order to
;;;; represent these constructed points explicitly, JTS must truncate them
;;;; to fit the PrecisionModel.
;;;;
;;;; Unfortunately, truncating coordinates moves them slightly. Line
;;;; segments which would not be coincident in the exact result may become
;;;; coincident in the truncated representation. This in turn leads to
;;;; "topology collapses" â€“ situations where a computed element has a lower
;;;; dimension than it would in the exact result.
